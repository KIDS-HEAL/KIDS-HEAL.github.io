<p>Thanks to the faith and generosity of Heather Killough, Jeannie and John McGuire, and Carrie Lawliss from the Harbourton Foundation, KIDS-HEAL is alive and kicking. A good idea is still simply an idea without research, testing and development. It takes funding to research, develop, test and refine new and innovative approaches to any problem. Financial support enables the initial idea to shift, evolve and materialize into a new working model.</p>
