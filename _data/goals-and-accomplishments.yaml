- title : Year 1
  footnote: The accomplishments of KIDS-HEAL during Year One are a direct result of the faith, support and encouragement from principal Betty Palmer, staff and teachers at South Baker Intermediary School in Baker City, Oregon.

    - title: IN-SCHOOL CLASSES
      desc : Our presentation to develop after-school arts+health programming at South Baker Elementary School in Baker City was received with such great enthusiasm that we were invited to bring our classes into the school day. After-school classes became in-school programming! This is HUGE to officially become part of the scheduled school day.

    - title: FREE LABOR
      desc : The shift from after-school to in-school programming transformed the entire teaching staff at South Baker Elementary into an army of 32 volunteers for KIDS-HEAL, including the principal, who works for us during our classes.

    - title: FREE FACILITY
      desc : Offering classes on campus eliminates all building rental and utility costs.

    - title: COMMUNITY OUTREACH ART PROTEST
      desc : We designed, painted and installed the first Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month Protest Mural, 2,600 square feet, that wrapped a building in Baker City. We have also installed over 800 square feet of art in downtown windows.

    - title: AFTER-SCHOOL CLASSES
      desc : After testing our in-school programming in Spring 2013, we offered Free Fridays in September. Free Fridays is an after-school program on Fridays, when Baker County schools are not in session. More than 20 percent of the entire student body attended our first Free Friday class, and each month is slowly growing as we invite 4th, 5th & 6th graders from neighboring communities, and all children who attend home/religious/charter schools, offering classes to approximately 80 percent of all 4th, 5th & 6th graders in Baker County. Kids help make their own lunches, and for many this may be the only good meal they get before the following Monday.

    - title: KIDS-HEAL PHILANTHROPY
      desc : We requested a limo to paint to bring special rides to special kids, from prom rides for foster kids in Baker City to Bright Lights for Sick Kids, which offered painted limo rides for children battling cancer during Christmas season to see holiday lights around Portland.

    - title: GREEN TEAM
      desc : After our Pediatric Cancer Awareness Action Month presentation at South Baker, two young women created GREEN TEAM to collect $500 worth of bottles and cans. This money was donated to a family in rural Oregon to help pay for gas for their trips to Doernbecher Children’s Hospital for their child’s cancer treatment.

    - title: FREE FOOD LABOR
      desc : Healthy snacks for 300 that were once prepared by the KIDS-HEAL Executive Director and the community liaison is now the responsibility of the culinary department at CAP Eagle Innovative High School. 25 volunteer hours each month.

    - title: SHRINKING FOOD COSTS
      desc : The Baker School District Food Service Director now orders our food to be delivered directly into our school; this eliminates the need for the executive director to bring food from wholesale outlets in Portland into Baker City.

    - title: NUTRITION CLASS ADJUSTMENTS
      desc : Making cancer education sandwiches and watching videos was how our nutrition classes started, but we have found that bringing in prepped snacks along with a healthcare professional to talk with the students about the monthly health topic has improved learning through interactive conversations. It took a year of relentless calling, but St. Alphonsis Hospital in Baker City now sends Lindsay Ganong, its community outreach specialist, to talk with students during our nutrition learning sessions each month and answer questions they may have. More free labor through a meaningful partnership!

    - title: ART CLASS STREAMLINING
      desc : Much of the equipment required for art classes was purchased in our first year, including the storage racks to store our food and art supplies. Brushes to markers, googly eyes to pipe cleaners, scissors and paint containers, tarps to cover the floor, knives, cutting boards and cups for Free Friday lunch, and small rolling carts that transport our supplies have been purchased. We are ready to invest money in programming now that the materials for our infrastructure are in-house.

    - title: SIMPLIFYING CLASS STRUCTURE
      desc : After six months of testing classes, Principal Betty Palmer and KIDS-HEAL founder Frank Etxaniz adjusted classes according to evaluations with teachers, students and volunteers. This adjustment included Frank’s initial desire to divide the school into tribes that bring together students from each grade, where students interact with students outside of their grade and where older students become mentors for younger students. Plus we shifted from five activity sessions to four during our 2-hour class.

    - title: ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION CHANGES
      desc : We used sheets of paper for our monthly pre- and post-evaluations when we began our journey. KIDS-HEAL is now shifting toward using iPADS + Google forms + Cloud storage to collect and process our monthly findings. We continue to adjust the number of questions and how we present them each month with the assistance of Rosemary Fitton, professional education evaluator, and Ali Chisti and his Harvard pre-med friends.

    - title: PAID STAFF TO VOLUNTEERS
      desc : The paid staff required to support our programming during research, movement and nutrition sessions is now being replaced by volunteers. More than 40 students graduating to middle school next year will come back to help teach what they have learned at South Baker. It’s KIDS TEACHING KIDS.

- title: Year 2
  items:
    - title: IN-SCHOOL CLASSES
      desc : Continue our work in Baker City with a paid volunteer coordinator and two volunteer assistants.

    - title: FREE LABOR
      desc : Bring the 8 to 10 volunteers each month, from the 40+ students who have graduated into middle school, back to South Baker to help us. They know our program first-hand and have proven to be a great asset in all classes, but particularly in the art classes.

    - title: FREE FACILITIES
      desc : We have a nearly 3,000-square-foot art studio on campus in Jordan Valley that will cost us $20 a month. We want to transform this space into a creative art and health studio. It looks as if we have room to grow in Crane also. The problems of finding art space in Baker City will not be a problem for our two new partners, Jordan Valley and Crane, in 2014-15.

    - title: COMMUNITY OUTREACH ART PROJECTS
      desc : We continue to work on our series of dinosaurs that will brand each community where KIDS-HEAL brings classes. Baker City is Elk-a-soar-us-wrecks, and we will wait and see what Jordan Valley and Crane come up with. Treasure Valley Community College in Ontario, the only college in the four counties of the Forgotten Corner of Oregon, is interested in promoting its welding program. My goal is to partner with them this year to begin creating our prototype dinos out of old, discarded metal tractor and farming objects.

    - title: AFTER-SCHOOL CLASSES
      desc : There will be no expansion of the after-school program until I have a better understanding of our two new partner schools. It took a year at South Baker before I expanded into after-school programming.

    - title: KIDS-HEAL PHILANTHROPY
      desc : We tested our “art popup shop” during the Hells Canyon Motorcycle Rally in Baker City mid-July 2014. Although it was not a great financial success, we earned the trust, and some money, from local business. And the children learned how to create a booth, prep it, work it, protect it every night, tally a cash box and work with the public. This core group of eight kids is already thinking about Christmas and next summer at the Miners Jubilee, a very local and more kid-friendly retail environment. I am training them so that I do not need to be with them in the future. This project will be organized with the assistance of the volunteer coordinator and a team of volunteers.

    - title: GREEN TEAM
      desc : As with any pre-teen club, there have been “break-ups,” changes of leadership, kids quitting, others joining for a week. But after a year we are back to the same group of kids who want to raise funds for KIDS-HEAL and gas money for rural families fighting cancer. Last year they raised $500 to donate to Doernbecher Children’s Hospital, and this year we are asking people and businesses to match what the kids raise. I have pledged to match the $500 to make sure we start where we ended last year. We have over 200 names of celebrities and news stations who will receive our call to action.

    - title: GUEST ARTISTS / DOCTORS / LEADERS
      desc : Our goal is to begin bringing the outside world to these small rural communities through guest artists and speakers, both in person and online. BodyVox, an internationally recognized dance company in Portland, is currently writing grants to come join us in the Forgotten Corner of Oregon, as is the Casey Eye Institute.

    - title: SHRINKING FOOD COSTS
      desc : "Initially I was making snacks each month, but the response was always the same: 1/3 liked it, 1/3 hated it, and 1/3 did not care. Food costs were as high if not higher than art supplies. I have adjusted to serving fresh fruit each month rather than addressing new foods. If parts of our project don’t work, then they are adjusted, and we have done so with healthy snacks that are now served at the end of our two-hour session rather than during the nutrition/video/speaker component of our classes."

    - title: WEBSITE AND HOW-TO VIDEOS
      desc : The digital aspect, from presentations to classes and newsletters, is now being reinvented with a group of 20-something young artists and filmmakers. Now that I know what we are doing and how it is done, I can begin the promotion phase. Develop first, then promote it. I tested the how-to videos last year and learned a lot. We will implement those lessons this year and bring in new art projects and artists into rural Oregon.

    - title: ART CLASS STREAMLINING
      desc : Much was learned last year. First is that kids can make GREAT art in 25 minutes. Students are now familiar with how KIDS-HEAL works, and they are not as hesitant as they were in the past to get started. T-shirts are our most successful canvases, and teachers are asking for more than just our digestive track on a T; they want the bones class and heart class to be done on Ts. Kids love them, wear them, and promote our program through them. I also have found a resource to purchase Ts at half of wholesale through a new partner in Baker City.

    - title: SIMPLIFYING CLASS STRUCTURE
      desc : The tribe concept of breaking up the 4th, 5th and 6th graders into four tribes has been a great success. And now that we have four classes rather than five, life is less manic with both students and teachers. Four classes at 25 minutes each makes classes a bit larger but more calm and focused. We are always fine-tuning.

    - title: ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION CHANGES
      desc : We have moved from paper to iPADS, but we now are focusing on how to retrieve data, not just the inputting of the answers to our questions. I am all over the state right now, as this is the most important issue to address. There is no replication without proper documentation, but how to retrieve will now redefine how and what we ask. Now that we have the school on board and a class structure that works, how do we implement what we have learned in a way that is true to grade-school students.

    - title: VOLUNTEERS ARE NOW PAID STAFF
      desc : Just as with CHAP, I am good at finding a replacement for me. Once I have designed and implemented a program, it is much easier to choose a person to manage it. This has been done, and I will shadow our volunteer coordinator in Baker City this year and let her take over in 2015-16.
