curriculumtext  : <p>Free interactive cancer education for children in all the Americas, en Español e Inglés</p>
importance         : 
  <p>The United States of America has the 5th highest rate of cancer in the world, and cancer is soon projected to take over heart disease as the no.1 killer of people in the US.  And although Mexico has a much lower cancer rate, the number of people being diagnosed with cancer is increasing at an alarming rate for Mexicans as well.</p>
  <p>37% of children surveyed believe cancer is contagious.</p>
  <p>30% - 60% of pediatric cancer patients report being bullied when returning to school.</p>
  <p>100% of pediatric cancer patients surveyed by KIDS-HEAL report being bullied at school.</p>
  <p>Too many children who have survived cancer are not surviving being bullied at school and are committing suicide.</p>
  <p>50% to 90% of children surveyed don’t believe that sunburns can cause cancer.</p>
  <p>The Knight Cancer Institute and the Biden Cancer Initiative are two powerful examples of cancer foundations that do not list education as a grant writing opportunity.</p>
believes         : 
  <p>Sensitive, challenging and difficult educational topics need to have some fun built in.</p>
  <p>Engaging both sides of our brains, as well as our bodies and taste buds, creates new ways to help students remember what is being presented.</p>
  <p>Any new innovative education platform needs to be tested in more than one language and in more than one country.</p>
  <p>KIDS-HEAL Cancer Education is fun, funny, fearless… and memorable.</p>
history         : 
  <p>The History of Cancer script was guided by my firsthand experience of making art with sick, dying and healing children on pediatric cancer floors in hospitals around the world.  The life lessons I learned with these children and their families are the heart and humor of my script. But Ken Burns, artist and documentarian, gives us an historical context for cancer in his brilliant film…CANCER The King of all Maladies and Dr. Linda Stork, rock star pediatric oncologist at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital encouraged, rearranged, improved and focused out script.  And as always Betty Palmer, teacher/principal/ assistant superintendent and KIDS-HEAL co-pilot and navigator reviews, edits and enriches each and every script written for schools.</p>
art         : 
  <p>The art of cancer explores how suffering and pain have created some of the world’s greatest works of art.  KIDS-HEAL artists will also show you that behind the pain, suffering and grief of cancer there is hope, faith, compassion, and HUMOR.  The ancient cave paintings of Altamira, the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the murals of Diego Rivera and Keith Haring educate us and inspire us.</p>
  <p>Art helps us remember… And seriously will you ever forget Bacon Boy vs. Sinister Sauce????</p>
